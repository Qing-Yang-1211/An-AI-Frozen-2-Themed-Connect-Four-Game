In this project, I modified one of the most beloved family games Connect 4 to 
integrate a high-level artificial intelligence and autonomy.

With a 7 columns Ã— 6 rows game board, the game can be played between two AI players, 
one AI player and one human player, or between two human players by calling playGame().

Each player has a checker 'X' or 'O', a tiebreaking type - left, right or random, 
and the ply - the number of moves that the player should look into the future when evaluating where to go next.

The game can also return a list of scores, representing the "goodness" of the player's next move into each column, in order to help players make wise decisions. 

In addition, in recognition of the new Frozen 2 movie, I have designed a Frozen 2 - themed game for human players.
Start the game to find out the story and try calling "Ahtohallan"! 
Ahtohallan is an ancient river that appears in Frozen 2. 
Described as a river "full of memories", Ahtohallan holds all the answers to the past.
It is taken from a beautiful song in Frozen 2, 'All is Found'. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)

Last but certainly not least - I was delighted to include a grutor mode (for HMC CS tutors)! Try calling the magic river "Ahtohallan"!

Happy connecting 4 and Merry Christmas!
